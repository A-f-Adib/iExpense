<h3> Description</h3> <br>

It is a simple ios project. In this project i built an app named iExpense with swift and swiftui, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), in order to accomplish those two things i learnt how to:

1. Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
2. Delete rows from a list
3. Save and load user data
... and much more.
